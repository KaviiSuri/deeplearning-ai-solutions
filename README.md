# deeplearning-ai-solutions
This Repo contains the notebooks that i made when going through deeplearning-ai specialization on coursers

## What I learned
This course was very intresting to me, it taught me both the math and intuition behind deep learning. From basic ANN to complex things like CNN and Sequence Models.
  This course also taught me about various applications of deep learning, like neural style transfer, image and object detection, machine translation, image captioning and many more.

This repo contains all the notebooks that I created as exercises in the course. Although this course uses tensorflow 1 and Keras, it gave me a strong foundation in deep learning and how it is implemented.

In short,  I learned about:
* Basics of ANN and backpropogation
* Convolutional Neural Networks and Their applications in computer vision
* Structuring, managing, implementing and debugging in a Deep Learning Project
* Improving and Hypertuning Deep Learning Models
* Sequence Models
* Transfer Learning
* Multi-Task Learning
* Tensorflow and Keras
